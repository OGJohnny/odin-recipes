    <p>
      This French Toast Monte Cristo Sandwich recipe is perfect for brunch.
      Monte Cristo sandwiches are basically a cross between grilled cheese and
      french toast, with ham added. Think of them as a french toast grilled ham
      and cheese.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>4 white sandwich bread slices</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>3oz roasted turkey breast, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3oz ham, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3oz Emmentaler or other cheese, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Red currant jelly, and peach jelly for serving</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Pour the milk in a shallow dish and crack the egg into it.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle a dash of seasonings into the mixture and whisk it thoroughly
        until the ingredients blend together to form a uniform, pale yellow
        mixture; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Take 2 bread slices and smother one side with 1 tsp of mustard.</li>
      <li>
        Top it up with turkey as well as ham slices and pile up half of the
        cheese over them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place another slice of bread over the final layer of cheese on top of
        each mustard-coated and give each sandwich a gentle press to make them
        more compact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a knob of butter into a large skillet and melt it over moderately
        low heat, until it foams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a sandwich into the whisked mixture and flip it over to coat either
        side well with the latter.
      </li>
      <li>Place it onto the skillet and coat the other sandwich similarly.</li>
      <li>
        Fry both of them for about 4-5 minutes, untouched, until they turn
        golden brown and turn them over to fry the other side in a similar
        fashion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the cheese melts, slide the sandwiches onto serving plates and
        sprinkle powdered sugar on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a dollop of red currant jelly and peach jelly (or jelly of choice)
        beside each sandwich and serve right away.
      </li>
    </ol>
